title: Tools & Packages

We have used various tols & packages to built DIEP 2.0, but in this section we will highlight the tools and package which are must to discuss.

## VS Code

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).

**Note:** VS Code has lots of extension available for development. One such extension is Microsoft Azure Extension which is a bundle of various Azure srvices and lets the developers connect to Azure using the native SDKs for varios coding language.

## Git

Git is a fast distributed revision control system.Repositories and Branches and Exploring Git history explain how to fetch and study a project using git—​read these chapters to learn how to build and test a particular version of a software project, search for regressions, and so on.

People needing to do actual development will also want to read Developing with Git and Sharing development with others.

**Note:** We particularly use GitLab as a remote repository for managing all our projects.
